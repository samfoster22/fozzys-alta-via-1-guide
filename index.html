            <h2>Preparation & Safety for Wild Camping</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Fitness:</strong> The AV1 is a moderate-to-strenuous trek, requiring excellent physical condition and experience with multi-day, self-supported hiking.</li>
                <li><strong>Gear:</strong> Pack light but be prepared for varied mountain weather. Essential items include sturdy hiking boots, lightweight tent/shelter, sleeping bag, cooking gear, waterproofs, layers, first-aid kit, navigation tools (map, compass, GPS), and a headlamp.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> The route is generally well-marked, but off-trail sections for camping may not be. A detailed topographic map, compass, and GPS device with downloaded GPX tracks are highly recommended. Learn to use them *before* your trip.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Water sources can be scarce between specific points. Plan your water carries carefully. Rifugios (huts) encountered along the way are good for refilling. Consider a water filter/purifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Wild Camping Regulations:</strong> Research and adhere to local wild camping rules. In many parts of the Dolomites, wild camping is restricted or forbidden, especially at lower altitudes and near huts. High alpine bivouacs (emergency shelters) or discreet, high-altitude pitches far from trails are generally tolerated if done responsibly (leave no trace!).</li>
                <li><strong>Food:</strong> Plan all your meals and carry sufficient lightweight, high-energy food. You cannot rely on huts for daily meals as you would on a hut-to-hut trek.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Pack out absolutely everything you pack in. Leave no trace of your presence.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Mountain weather can change rapidly from sunny to storms with hail and snow, even in summer. Check multiple forecasts daily. Be prepared to adapt your plans.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> Know local emergency numbers (e.g., 112 in Italy) and carry a fully charged phone. A satellite messenger or personal locator beacon (PLB) is recommended for remote areas. Inform someone of your itinerary.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect Wildlife & Environment:</strong> Stay on marked trails, do not disturb wildlife, and minimize your impact on the delicate alpine environment.</li>
